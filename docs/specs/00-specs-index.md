# Specs Index

This directory contains the repository's source-of-truth specs for intended
behavior.

Use this numbered index as the canonical starting point for specs. Keep
`README.md` as a thin pointer so directory browsing and numbered read order
stay aligned instead of competing.

## Rules

- Specs define intended behavior, invariants, and verification expectations.
- Specs use stable reference codes so plans and code can cite exact
  requirements.
- Specs backlink related plans under `## Related Plans`.
- If behavior changes materially, update the spec before or with the code.

## Recommended Starting Points

1. `01-development-documentation-operating-model.md`
2. `10-minimum-memory-model.md`
3. `11-minimum-write-search-context-slice.md`
4. `12-local-app-surface.md`
5. `14-embedded-weft-execution-model.md`
6. `13-context-assembly-and-arcs.md`
7. `15-foundation-contracts-and-invariants.md`

## Naming

- Use stable filenames.
- Numbered prefixes are recommended when the corpus is expected to grow.
- Prefer concise, descriptive titles over ticket-like names.

## Related Surfaces

- `docs/plans/` for execution
- `docs/implementation/` for rationale and repository maps
- `skills/` for reusable workflow instructions
